# Coralations
Website developed for the Hackathon NASA Space Apps COVID-19 Challenge on May 30 and 31 2020. 
## Overview:
The NASA Space Appps Hackathon was a competition where  every group had to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 in specific scenarios. My group decided to study how it impacted nature, more specifically corals.
The website was developed for a hackathon, so everything was coded and implemented in less than 48 hours.
I wrote All html, css and js code on this roject was by myself. The Tableau charts, good chuncks of the research, logos and images were all chosen by my group.
