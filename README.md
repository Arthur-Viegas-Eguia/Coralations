# Coralations
Website developed for the Hackathon NASA Space Apps COVID-19 Challenge on May 30 and 31 2020. 
## Overview:
The NASA Space Appps Hackathon was a competition where every group had to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 in specific fields. My group decided to study how quarantines impacted nature, more specifically corals.

The website was developed for a hackathon, so everything was coded and implemented in less than 48 hours.
I wrote All html, css and js code on this project by myself. The Tableau charts, good chuncks of the research, logos and images were all chosen/developed by my group.

Special thanks to Talia Calazans, Fabiana Luft, Jamile Falc√£o, Victor Maia, Eliseu Kloster Filho for all the help with the project and for making it possible to develop Coralations
